# Portfolio - Andr√© Silva

### I'm a 32 years old Brazilian guy, currently living in Saint Petersburg, Russia. I'm looking for my first job as a Full-Stack Web Developer.

This is the current version (as of April 2020) of my Portfolio. It's made using a variety of technologies, including React,
Express, MongoDB Atlas and Mongoose.

I'm planning on converting the current JavaScript files into TypeScript, and on adding new apps to it in the days and weeks to come, as I learn new things.
